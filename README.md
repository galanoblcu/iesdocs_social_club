# IESDocs Social Club
This is a public repository for doc migration test in IES Docs team. Take it as a playground for fun!!!

.....

## Folder
You can create folders as needed. Some folders, for example, *Tpc*, was created for integration test on markdown and lightweight DITA. 

## Tools
### Authoring Tools
- If you are authoring in DITA, try oXygen XML editor. The latest version is 23.1. https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/versions/23.1/ug-editor/index.html 
- If you are working in Markdown, you have various options, for example, notepad, visual studio code, atom, notepad++, github desktop, gitkraken, oxygen, or web editor embedded in Github, that is, here.
- If you are working on image processing, Adobe Illustrator.

### Source File Management Tool
- In the current test, I use Gitkraken. See https://nio365.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/IESDocumentation/Shared%20Documents/Internal%20Projects/Dita_Repo_for_test_only/demo_/06_18_2021_Git%20it%20done.pptx?d=wa93fb345eb18403db327ff61e39db603&csf=1&web=1&e=LyAUGZ 
- Github Desktop is also convenient to use as a tool but it lacks support to AzDo. 

## Installation and Configuration
See https://nio365.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/IESDocumentation/Shared%20Documents/Internal%20Projects/Dita_Repo_for_test_only/demo_/06_18_2021_Git%20it%20done.pptx?d=wa93fb345eb18403db327ff61e39db603&csf=1&web=1&e=LyAUGZ.

Note that since most of the tests were done in Gitlab, so the majority part of the content in the ppt above are mainly for Gitlab users. But the steps in Gitkraken is roughtly the same, just replace Gitlab with Github. Of course, the ppt will be updated soon.

## Output Generation
- If you are working with lwDITA + Markdown, or, MDITA, open a ditamap or a topic and generate the output from oXygen XML Editor.
- If you are working with pure Markdown, the Preview mode in almost every editor allows you to check the actual effect. Be careful with the Markdown syntax. See: https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/ and https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/markdown/.

## Tables in Markdwon
Table creation and maintenance could be annoying even after months of experience with MD. There are some handy tools you can use to speed up the table creation or modification, aka. Table Generator. See https://jakebathman.github.io/Markdown-Table-Generator/ and https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables.
